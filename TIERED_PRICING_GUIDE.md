### **Understanding the Fields**

#### **Min Qty (Minimum Quantity)**
- Enter the minimum quantity required for this pricing tier
- Must be a whole number (1, 5, 10, 50, etc.)
- Tiers should be in ascending order

#### **Price Field**
- **For Fixed Price**: Enter the exact price (e.g., 25.00 for $25.00)
- **For Percentage**: Enter the discount percentage (e.g., 5.55 for 5.55% off)

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Pricing Logic**
- Tiers are applied based on **minimum quantity**
- The **best price** is automatically selected for the customer
- If no tier matches, the regular price is used

### **Quantity Rules**
- Minimum quantity should be 1 or higher
- Tiers should be in ascending order (5, 10, 50, not 50, 5, 10)
- Each tier applies when the customer orders **at least** that quantity

### **Price Calculation**
- **Fixed Price**: Customer pays exactly this price per item
- **Percentage**: Discount is calculated from the regular price
- Example: Regular price $40, 10% discount = $36 per item

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Setting Up Effective Tiers**
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 tiers per role
2. **Reasonable Gaps**: Don't make huge jumps (5→10→25 is better than 5→50→100)
3. **Test Pricing**: Ensure your margins work at each tier
4. **Clear Communication**: Make sure customers understand the pricing structure

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- ❌ Setting minimum quantity to 0
- ❌ Using negative percentages
- ❌ Creating overlapping tiers
- ❌ Not testing the pricing logic

### **Testing Your Setup**
1. Create a test order with different quantities
2. Verify the correct price is applied
3. Check that the best tier is selected
4. Test with different customer roles

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Price Not Updating**
- Make sure you clicked **"Update"** or **"Publish"**
- Check that the customer has the correct role
- Verify the minimum quantity is met

### **Percentage Not Working**
- Ensure you selected **"Percentage"** in the Type dropdown
- Enter the percentage as a number (10 for 10%, not 0.10)
- Check that the regular price is set

### **Tiers Not Showing**
- Verify the product is published
- Check that the customer is logged in
- Ensure the customer has the correct B2B role
