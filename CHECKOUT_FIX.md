# B2B Commerce Pro - Checkout Issue Fix

## Problem
When wholesale customers tried to checkout with fewer items than the minimum quantity requirement, they would see an error message: "There are some issues with the items in your cart. Please go back to the cart page and resolve these issues before checking out."

## Root Cause
The B2B Commerce Pro plugin was enforcing strict minimum quantity requirements:
- Wholesale customers: Minimum 10 items
- Distributors: Minimum 50 items  
- Retailers: Minimum 5 items

The `enforce_min_max_quantity` method in `PricingManager.php` was adding error notices that prevented checkout when minimum quantities weren't met.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Flexible Quantity Settings
Added a new settings section in the admin panel (B2B → Checkout Controls) with options to:
- **Enforce Minimum Quantity**: Toggle to enable/disable minimum quantity enforcement
- **Behavior when minimum not met**: Choose between:
  - **Block checkout (Error)**: Original behavior
  - **Allow with warning**: Shows notice but allows checkout
  - **Ignore completely**: No restrictions

### 2. Updated Validation Logic
Modified `PricingManager.php` to:
- Check the new quantity settings before enforcing restrictions
- Show appropriate notices based on the chosen behavior
- Allow checkout to proceed when configured to do so

### 3. Reduced Demo Minimums
Updated demo pricing rules to be more reasonable:
- Wholesale customers: 5 items (was 10)
- Distributors: 20 items (was 50)
- Retailers: 1 item (was 5)

## How to Configure

1. Go to **WordPress Admin → B2B → Checkout Controls**
2. Scroll down to **Minimum Quantity Settings**
3. Choose your preferred behavior:
   - **Enforce Minimum Quantity**: Enable/disable the feature
   - **Behavior**: Select how to handle customers who don't meet minimums

## Files Modified

- `includes/PricingManager.php`: Updated validation logic
- `includes/AdminPanel.php`: Added quantity settings UI
- `b2b-commerce-pro.php`: Reduced demo minimum quantities

## Testing

1. Login as a wholesale customer
2. Add fewer than 5 items to cart
3. Try to checkout
4. Should now work with a warning notice (if configured for warnings)

## Notes

- Maximum quantity restrictions still work as before
- Pricing rules still apply correctly based on quantity thresholds
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Admin can easily adjust behavior without code changes
- **Fixed**: Duplicate notices issue - now shows only one notice per unique minimum quantity requirement

## Recent Fix (Duplicate Notices)

**Problem**: Multiple duplicate notices were appearing on the checkout page for the same minimum quantity requirements.

**Solution**: 
- Added session-based flag to prevent duplicate processing
- Collect all notices and display them only once
- Clear the flag when cart is updated to allow new notices when needed
- Each unique minimum quantity requirement now shows only one notice
